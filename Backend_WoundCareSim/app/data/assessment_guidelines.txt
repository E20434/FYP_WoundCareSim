Wound Assessment Guidelines

Assessment should be done before removing the dressing if possible.

Key aspects of assessment include:
- Location of the wound
- Type of incision
- Presence of discharge
- Condition of surrounding skin

Redness combined with warmth may indicate infection and should be escalated.
