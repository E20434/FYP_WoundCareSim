History Taking Guidelines for Post-Operative Wound Care

The nurse should introduce themselves and confirm patient identity.

Important history questions include:
- Presence of allergies
- Pain level at the wound site
- Any previous wound complications
- Current medications

Clear explanation of the procedure helps reduce patient anxiety and improves cooperation.
