Procedure: Surgically Clean Wound Care – Left Forearm

Before beginning any wound care procedure, the nurse must perform proper hand hygiene using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub.

Personal protective equipment such as gloves must be worn before touching the wound or dressing materials.

The wound should be assessed for signs of infection including redness, warmth, swelling, increased pain, or purulent discharge.

Cleaning should be performed using sterile saline, moving from the cleanest area to the least clean area.

Failure to perform hand hygiene before wound cleaning is considered a critical safety violation.
